###Playlist2XBMC - send YouTube Playlists from Chrome to XBMC
I am an avid XBMC user and I noticed the lack of an easy way to queue (multiple) YouTube videos and playlists from a web-browser to XBMC. That is why I created Playlist2XBMC, a Google Chrome extension that enables you to send and create playlists from YouTube to XBMC. The extension talks to the JSON-RPC API of XBMC (from 11.0 Eden and beyond) using AJAX in order to manage a playlist.  The current version has the following functions:

 - Adds a play button to every YouTube page which ‘inserts’ the video into your playlist and plays it right away

- Adds a plus button to every YouTube page which adds the video at the end of the playlist queue

- Adds a clear button to every YouTube page to clear your current playlist

- In case of a YouTube playlist-bar, it adds a button to play that YouTube playlist on your XBMC

- Adds play and plus buttons to the search results on YouTube

[Download it for free in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mgajimdehjbpldnldemmfigkepdahkik)

Update: This addon is out of date and no longer supported, as a replacement I recommend [Play to XBMC](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/play-to-xbmc/fncjhcjfnnooidlkijollckpakkebden/details)
