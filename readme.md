Personal blog
=============

Source code of my static [website](http://rickvandeloo.com).
It's a real basic setup (jekyll + bootstrap) but it fits my needs
regarding a simple blogging platform.

To generate the static site install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
[pygments](http://pygments.org/) on your system, then simply run

```
$ jekyll build
```
